An attempt to flush and hold writes on volume %2 was attempted while another flush and hold was already in progress.
An error occurred while trying to delete a snapshot of %2.  The delete will be retried at a later time.
An unfinished create of a shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted.
An volume offline for cluster failover was expected, but a mount request arrived instead.  A failure occurred attempting to take the volume offline to compensate.

The flush and hold operation for volume %2 was aborted because of low available system memory.
The flush and hold writes operation on volume %2 timed out while waiting for a release writes command.
The flush and hold writes operation on volume %2 timed out while waiting for file system cleanup.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to allow shadow copies created afterward and marked for delete to be deleted.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to keep disk space usage for shadow copies of volume %2 below the user defined limit.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to keep the total number of shadow copies of volume %2 below a limit.
The revert operation on volume %2 encountered a bad sector error.  Please validate the data on this volume.
The revert operation on volume %2 stopped because of the loss of a volume.  When the volume is re-introduced, the revert will continue.  You may have to reboot to trigger the revert.
The reverting of volume %2 is being restarted.  This is most likely because of a system shutdown or a system crash.
The reverting of volume %2 to the state of a previous shadow copy is complete.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of a failed free space computation.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of an IO failure on volume %3.
