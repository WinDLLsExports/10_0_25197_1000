The file name template '%ls' has multiple wildcards; only one wildcard is supported
The file's CloseUserInfo size (%Iu) is too small. Expected size: %Iu. Assuming defaults.

The -OnLaunch and -Persistent options are incompatible and may not be specified together
The -OnLaunch option may only be used with -Parent with this version of TTD

The provided options do not request any action be taken
The requested minimum generation (%u) is beyond the file's maximum (%u). There's no usable data in the file.
The specified directory, '%ls', is not a directory
The specified -MaxFile size of %u MB is invalid.  For ring mode recording, the value must be between %u and %u MB.  For non-ring recording, the value must be at least %u MB.
The specified trace file name '%ls' cannot be used for service-mode recording.  A directory name, or a file name containing wildcards must be used.
The stream ID (%u) is invalid: points outside of the ring
The stream is not valid
The stream is null
The -TExit option required -Timer to be specified
The version of the Process Launch Monitor driver installed is too old.
There was an error trying to modify dependencies for service "%ls" (%ls).
There were errors in profile setup. This distribution of TTTracer.exe does not support managed recording.
These services and service host groups will be recorded on launch:
This can be done in two ways: (i) with a configuration file, and (ii)
This function cannot be called on a default constructed task
This recording session is using TTD on a downlevel OS. If you use other options to interact with this recording session  (e.g. -stop, -delete, -terminate) remember to use -noredirect as the first parameter.
