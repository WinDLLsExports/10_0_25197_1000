The '%ls' argument must be followed by the program or app to be traced
The '-%ls' option must be the first option
The argument for hardware tracing is malformed
The -AutoStart option and service configuration options are incompatible and may not be specified together
The -AutoStart option is incompatible with the -OnLaunch option; they may not be specified together
The -CmdLineFilter and -Attach options are incompatible and may not be specified together
The -CmdLineFilter and -LoadOnly options are incompatible and may not be specified together
The communication channel was created with a different version of TTD
The configuration file is too large
The -Context and -Attach options are incompatible and may not be specified together
The -Context and -LoadOnly options are incompatible and may not be specified together
The -Context option is not supported on this operating system
The file is unusable. Its OpenUserInfo has size (%Iu). Expected size: %Iu. Aborting.
The file name template '%ls' has multiple wildcards; only one wildcard is supported
The file's CloseUserInfo size (%Iu) is too small. Expected size: %Iu. Assuming defaults.
The guest process is already being recorded
The list provided was not properly null-terminated.
The -MaxConcurrentRecordings option must specify a value higher than 0
The monitor service is not installed
The monitor service was installed and has been started.
The monitor service was installed, but it could not be started. It will be started on startup.
The monitoring thread has failed
The -OnLaunch and -Persistent options are incompatible and may not be specified together
The -OnLaunch option may only be used with -Parent with this version of TTD
The -OnLaunch options requires -Out to be specified
The -Parent option may not be used when recording services
The -Parent option may not be used with -Children. -Children will be ignored.
The -Plm option is incompatible with the Service Configuration options
The -Plm option requires -Out to be specified
The process is already being record by TTD
The process is not being recorded by TTD
The Process Launch Monitor driver is not installed
The Process Monitor Server cannot be reconfigured using this version of TTD
The provided options do not request any action be taken
The requested minimum generation (%u) is beyond the file's maximum (%u). There's no usable data in the file.
The specified directory, '%ls', is not a directory
The specified -MaxFile size of %u MB is invalid.  For ring mode recording, the value must be between %u and %u MB.  For non-ring recording, the value must be at least %u MB.
The specified trace file name '%ls' cannot be used for service-mode recording.  A directory name, or a file name containing wildcards must be used.
The stream ID (%u) is invalid: points outside of the ring
The stream is not valid
The stream is null
The -TExit option required -Timer to be specified
The version of the Process Launch Monitor driver installed is too old.
There was an error trying to modify dependencies for service "%ls" (%ls).
There were errors in profile setup. This distribution of TTTracer.exe does not support managed recording.
These services and service host groups will be recorded on launch:
This can be done in two ways: (i) with a configuration file, and (ii)
This function cannot be called on a default constructed task
This recording session is using TTD on a downlevel OS. If you use other options to interact with this recording session  (e.g. -stop, -delete, -terminate) remember to use -noredirect as the first parameter.
ThreadId
ThreadId=<id>              Specify the thread id (in decimal).
